The science bowl students and some of the event coordinators have requested that we move back to the original draft schedule with 4 time blocks.  They are concerned about the amount of time required for grading and completing the paperwork. Therefore, we are reverting to the original draft schedule with 4 time blocks.  I apologize for the confusion; however, schedule changes are a common event in the B/C Regional Olympiad, NorCal Olympiad and even at the National Olympiad level.  These changes often have to take place on the very day of the competition so teams have to be somewhat "flexible" in terms of assignments.

Please re-submit your science bowl requests to James Hill. If you send these ASAP, I'll be able to add them to the schedule for tomorrow's meeting. Also, so far, I only have one school listed as bringing students to the science bowl buzzer practice at 4:30 PM.
