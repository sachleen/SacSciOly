NorCal Joint Regional Tournament The Bearso Invitational was held on Oct. 10th and was a success thanks to Bay Area Regional Director Peter Hung and his team. After discussion with the seven NorCal Regional Directors it was decided we would have ONE NorCal Joint Regional Tournament online March 6, 2021. Although all Regions will take the same tests at the same time with the same Event Supervisors and on the same website, scoring and awards will be done separately by Region. Information on registering for the Joint Regional to follow. Meanwhile, continue to register and pay for the Regional tournament on our current website.

3.  ‘OnShape” is a free program for educators and students.  It is a “possible” program that might be used for Write It Do It.https://www.onshape.com/en/education/.  It will be used for the practice test events that some teams might have signed up for on Saturday.  
4.    For the vehicle events, we understand that space will be challenging. The vehicle events this year are written so that the speed of the vehicle has no impact on the score. When the rules were written, it was intended so that it can be run on any type of surface as long as they can get it consistently. For example, this year, having a sloped track (like driveway) is okay as long as that’s what they’ve been practicing and they can calibrate the vehicle so it stops at the same location consistently.

That’s all for now.
