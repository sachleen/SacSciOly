The Science Olympiad Rules will be released at 9am CST on 9.4.18 in the [Science Olympiad Store](https://store.soinc.org/us/page/manuals?resetallfilter=1). Like last year, anyone can visit the Store page, agree to the terms of use, and get the free Rules PDFs.

All the [Invitational](https://www.soinc.org/play/invitationals) dates for those sites which sent in their Tournament Director forms are now available. If you are planning to run an invitational, then you must obtain approval of the State Director and register your tournament with National.  In order to participate in an invitational, you must be registered for the 2019 Sacramento Regional Science Olympiad. 

The 2019 Sacramento registration packets will be mailed out later this week.
