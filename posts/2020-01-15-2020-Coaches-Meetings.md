The Division A Science Olympiad coaches meeting will be held on Wednesday, January 15, 2020, at Mira Loma High School in room F-3 from 5-6 PM.    The address for Mira Loma is 4000 Edison Avenue, Sacramento, CA 95821.  Please see the attached map of the Mira Loma campus and park behind the E Wing, behind the cafeteria or in the West student parking lot.  We will not be providing refreshments for this meeting.  The Mira Loma Science Bowl team will be there in order to demonstrate how the Science Bowl event will take place.  If you have students who are interested in attending, please feel free to bring them for an introduction to the event and the buzzer system.  

The purpose of this meeting is for planning, schedule review, event discussion, and volunteer recruitment.  The meeting will be relatively short and informal; however, if needed, sufficient time will be allowed for B and C schools to work collaboratively and to discuss both old and new events.
