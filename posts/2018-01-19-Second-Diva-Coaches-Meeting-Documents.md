Please read the items on the agenda and make note of the due dates.  The next coaches meeting will be held on Wednesday, February 14, 2018.  

If you have not submitted your official registration documents and registration fees, please do this as quickly as possible.  If for some reason you have NOT received the pdf of the official rules, please let me know so that I can send a copy.

There is still time for additional schools to register!  

**REMINDER:** Most of the events have Event Coordinators at this time; however, each school is responsible for  providing TWO volunteers to assist with an event.  

Information concerning registering for SCIENCE BOWL will be emailed on Monday, January 22nd. Teams will be able to request specific time blocks for this event.

The SCHEDULE of events is a DRAFT schedule.   

PLEASE NOTE:  CHOPPER CHALLENGE WILL NOT BE AN EVENT THIS YEAR.  IT IS REPLACED WITH CESSNA PROPELLER PROPULSION.  The event guidelines are included below.

Please encourage other schools to participate.
