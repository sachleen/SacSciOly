Dear Coaches,

I hope everyone is doing well, staying healthy and adjusting to distance learning.  I wanted to provide an update on the Division A Science Olympiad: At the time when SJUSD schools were dismissed, the goal was to reschedule the division A competition in May when we returned, but now that school is canceled for the remainder of the year, we won’t be able to have the 2020 event. The dues, medals, trophies, ribbons, printing, etc. were all paid, purchased and received early on before the current Covid-19 situation.    Due to the small number of schools, Division A doesn’t “pay” for itself and is actually dependent on any money left over from the B/C competition; however, those funds are also  limited this year because we did not fully receive our donations that were promised.  

We will be able to recycle some of the medals , trophies and such for next year so depending on how everything progresses, the 2021 registration fees will be adjusted/reduced for schools that paid this year and want to compete next year.  The same events and guidelines will be used for the 2021 event.  

That’s the best I can do at this point.

Thanks,
James Hill
