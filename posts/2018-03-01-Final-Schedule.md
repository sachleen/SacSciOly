The FINAL 2018 Science Olympiad schedule is attached.  All team assignments and room numbers are present on the schedule. **Please do NOT use any of the previous versions of the schedule because they are no longer valid.**

## REMINDERS:
Even though the schedule says registration starts at 8:00, we will begin at 7:30 or earlier if possible.  Specific schools will need to check-in ASAP on Saturday morning due to participating in WIDI at 8:00 AM.  Please move to the front of the line when registration opens:

MIDDLE SCHOOLS:

- Pomolita A
- Pomolita B
- Granite Oaks MS

HIGH SCHOOLS:

- St. Francis HS-A
- Del Campo HS-B
- Sacramento Waldorf
- Vista del Lago HS
- Leroy Greene Academy

Rain is forecast for Saturday, and you have been assigned a homeroom in the A-Wing of Mira Loma. The coaches, adults and students will be responsible for maintaining order in the room and making certain the room is clean and returned to its original condition at the end of the day. The teacher's materials, equipment, supplies, etc. should not be disturbed.

Please note: Certain areas of the A-Wing will be off-limits to everyone and will be roped off.

If the rain clears, Do NOT set-up your camp in the hallways or outside of the testing rooms. You will be asked to move if you locate your teams in any of these areas. It is noisy and distracting to the students who are testing, and it interferes with the passage from one event to the next.

REMINDER: All students must have a bracelet and admission ticket(1/2 sheet) in order to participate in an event.

Please have your volunteers enter for registration on the side of the F-wing near the Quad. You are responsible for providing a lunch for your volunteers. It is important that ALL volunteers show up for their assigned events.

Do not park in the EAST Parking Lot. This lot is reserved for the Event Coordinators, volunteers and other people who are assisting with the competition.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
