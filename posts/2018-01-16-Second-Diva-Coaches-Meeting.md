The second coaches meeting will be held on Wednesday, January 17, 2018, at Mira Loma High School in room F-3 from 5-6 PM. The address for Mira Loma is 4000 Edison Avenue, Sacramento, CA 95821. Please see the attached map of the Mira Loma campus and park in the East Parking Lot. (F-3 is located in the round building on the map.) We will not be providing refreshments for this meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is for planning, event discussion, and moving forward with the 2018 tournament. The meeting will be relatively short and informal; however, this will be an important meeting because there are important topics that need to be discussed.

I look forward to seeing you on January 17, 2018. If you are unable to attend, all documents will be sent out electronically later in the week.

If you know of any additional schools (grades 3-6) that might be interested, it is not too late to register. See the [Registration Info](registration-info) section for details.
