The second coaches meeting will be held on Wednesday, January 17, 2018, at Mira Loma High School in room F-3 from 4-5 PM. The address for Mira Loma is 4000 Edison Avenue, Sacramento, CA 95821. Please see the attached map of the Mira Loma campus and park in the East Parking Lot. (F-3 is located in the round building on the map.)  We will not be providing refreshments for this meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is for planning, schedule review, event discussion, and volunteer recruitment. The meeting will be relatively short and informal; however, if needed, sufficient time will be allowed for B and C schools to work collaboratively and to discuss both old and new events.

I look forward to seeing you on January 17, 2018. If you are unable to attend, all documents will be sent out electronically later in the week.
