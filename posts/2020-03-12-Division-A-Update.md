**At this point, we are POSTPONING the Sacramento Division A Science Olympiad that is scheduled for Saturday, March 21, 2020.** The following information is from the National Science Olympiad headquarters:

>The Science Olympiad National Executive Board has recommended that all Science Olympiad Division B and C qualifying tournaments on a forward-going basis be cancelled and will support any stateâ€™s decision to halt the 2019-2020 season. Please consider canceling any state-sancioned Elementary Science Olympiad Tournaments as well. We do realize that different parts of the country are experiencing the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation disproportionately, but in this instance, we feel that supporting each other and showing solidarity to those students who are affected is important. Health and safety come first.


At this point, we are **POSTPONING** the Sacramento Division A Science Olympiad that is scheduled for Saturday, March 21, 2020.  
Hopefully, we will be able to reschedule this event later in the school year, possibly in May.

I realize that this is disappointing news; however, the safety of our students and all people involved is our primary concern.  I will be in contact with you and keep you updated on changes and schedules. 

Thanks,
James Hill
