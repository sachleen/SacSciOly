## Registration Requirements

### Team Sizes

Teams may have no more than 15 students. Schools may enter multiple teams if space is available. Each team must have their own coach. Division C teams may have a maximum of seven 12th graders. Division B teams may have a maximum of five 9th graders.

### Membership Fees

The membership fee is $350 per team ($250 for division A teams). This fee includes the Local, NorCal, and National membership fees. Membership fees must be submitted with registration and are not refundable.

### Volunteers

Each team must provide a minimum of 2 volunteers to help on the day of the event. Submission of the registration form and registration fee indicates that you and your school are aware of the responsibility to provide two volunteers to cover specific events on the day of the regional Science Olympiad. In the coaches meeting we will discuss the requirements and responsibilities of the volunteers and consequences for teams who do not provide volunteers.


Winning teams will also be responsible for providing volunteers and Event Coordinators for the NorCal State Science Olympiad.
